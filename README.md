# Here Be Dragons

## Setup
1. Fork and clone
2. Run `gem install awesome_print`
2. run rspec to confirm you have 1 passing test, and 3 pending tests

## Directions

This repo will help you practice your nested iteration/collection skills. You will need to update each test in order to finish these tasks. You'll notice that the first test is done for you. In each test, you will need to define a variable called `result` that returns the information that is asked of you. Continue unskipping your tests to make sure that your solution works.
